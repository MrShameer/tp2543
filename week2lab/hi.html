      My name is Shameer Ali. This my page for the week 2 laboratory assignment of web programming course. Well, web programming is not a new thing for me and it is one of my favorite in terms of project development. At this page, i will describe about myself in a short introduction on my favorite places, pictures and my computing skills.
      <br><br>
      Short introduction to myself, I am a person with a very positive personality plus. I love to explore new things in life and get new experience along the way. One of my life principle is that in order to be happy, we have to live our life with zero expectations. Well that's self explanatory so apart form that, life is about living the moment and do the this we love. I like to learn new things and go into territory that i'm not familiar with.
      <br><br>
      Personally, i like to make new friends, i want to get to know what kind of people are out there. For me it's like adventures, we don't know who we gonna meet. To be honest, i cannot fully express myself through just two paragraphs, so if you want to get to know me well then
