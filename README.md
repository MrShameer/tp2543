# About TP2543
This project is a web development project developed for my University course. This project uses HTML, PHP, Jquery and JavaScript. You can check out the project [Here](http://lrgs.ftsm.ukm.my/users/a173586/)

# Notes
### Database
- All the database.php in scripts like [login.php](mypt4/login.php#L2), [product.php](mypt4/products_crud.php#L2) or any other php file can be refered to [database_reference.php](mypt4/database_reference.php)
- It's the same file, just change the name and put in your values.
- I also provided the database files with their credentials in: [database.php](mypt4/database.php) | [db.php](week6lab/db.php)

### ThreeJS
- I use [ThreeJs](https://threejs.org/) in this project for my UI and 3d Models. (For students following this repo, you don't need to use this if you don't want)
- If you wish to implement this, just put this [Code](three.min.js) in your project folder.
